    ///////// CHAT /////

Backend Integration:

    You'll need backend logic to handle the challenge functionality.
    Endpoints to send and receive challenge requests between users.
    Database or storage to manage the challenge state and history.

Frontend Implementation:

    Create a UI for sending challenges. already set up a button for sending a challenge.
    Implement a mechanism to handle the state of the challenge request. This could involve using React state or a state management library (like Redux).
    When the "Challenge" button is clicked, trigger a function that sends a challenge request to the friend you're chatting with.

Handling Challenge Responses:

    After sending the challenge, you'll need to wait for a response.
    Implement a way to display the challenge request to the recipient. This might involve a notification or a separate UI component.
    Add functionality for the recipient to accept or refuse the challenge. This might include buttons or other UI elements for response actions.

Updating UI Based on Responses:

    Once a response is received (accept/refuse), update the UI accordingly. For instance, if the challenge is accepted, you might show a success message or start the challenge. If refused, handle the rejection gracefully.

Real-Time Updates:

    real-time updates, consider using WebSocket or a similar technology to notify users about incoming challenges or their responses without manual refreshing.

## Issues:
